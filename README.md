This extension lets user bookmark posts.

Bookmarked posts appear under the additional bookmarks page.

In this initial version there is no option to sort bookmarked posts or group them by discussion.
They are sorted by creation date.

## Installation

    composer require flarumtr/flarum-ext-post-bookmarks
